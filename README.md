## Getting Started

To set up the 3D Portfolio project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cprogmer231/3d-portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd 3d-portfolio
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Use npm or yarn to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Your application will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technologies Used

This project uses several technologies to create a rich user experience:

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Three.js**: A cross-browser JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D graphics.
- **React-Three-Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js that makes it easier to work with 3D graphics in React.

## How to Use

Once you have set up the project, you can start customizing your portfolio. Here are some key components you can modify:

- **Header**: Add your name and a brief introduction.
- **About Section**: Describe your skills and experiences.
- **Projects Section**: Showcase your work with images and links.
- **Contact Section**: Provide your contact information or links to social media.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to add a 3D model to your portfolio:

```jsx
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber';
import { Box } from '@react-three/drei';

function App() {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <ambientLight />
      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
      <Box args={[1, 1, 1]} position={[0, 0, 0]}>
        <meshStandardMaterial attach="material" color="orange" />
      </Box>
    </Canvas>
  );
}
```

This code creates a basic 3D box in your portfolio. You can replace the `Box` component with any 3D model you want to display.
